## Instructions

### How to run

You can find a playable version at [jrchapprogrammer/FEND-Arcade-Game](https://jrchapprogrammer.github.io/FEND-Arcade-Game/).

### Gameplay

To start, <!-- you may select a **character**. Once selected,  -->your character starts at the bottom of the field. The goal is to get your character to the **water**, while **avoiding the bugs**. If you get attacked by any bugs, your character has to start over.

## Dependencies

The _index.html_, _engine.js_ game engine, _resources.js_ image loader, _app.js_ starting code, sprite assets and css were all provided by Udacity.

I also brought in a sprite collision algorithm provided by [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13916966/adding-collision-detection-to-images-drawn-on-canvas).
